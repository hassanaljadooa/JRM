# JRM (Just Remind Me)

JRM is a web application designed to serve as a reminder app. All the operations occur on the client side, including data storage (using localStorage). Unlike a traditional vertical list-based app, JRM adopts a card-based approach with ample whitespace, ensuring it doesn't feel cluttered even with multiple reminders.

Please note that JRM is still a work in progress and is actively being developed. Currently, I have invested approximately 16 hours into the project, which means there is still a lot of work to be done.

## Running your own instance

Setting up your own instance of JRM is straightforward if you are familiar with ***NPM*** and ***Vite***. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open a terminal window inside the cloned repository.
3. Run ***npm i*** and wait for the installation of dependencies to finish.
4. Execute ***npm run dev*** to run the application.

You can also deploy it to ***Vercel*** by creating a new project from this repo, the rest will be handled by Vercel. When asked to select a web framework, choose ***Vite*** it will most likely be selected by default but double check to sure, other than that no config required.

## Open Source

JRM is released under the permissive MIT license, allowing anyone to use it in any manner they desire without any obligations. However, if you decide to build upon my project, I would greatly appreciate pull requests.
